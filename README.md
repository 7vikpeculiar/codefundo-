# Our idea

Hi everyone, this is our awesome idea for **codefundo**. Our idea is to build an app. We named as ***Companio***

***Compania*** is a web/ mobile app with some offline functionality.
We believe that disaster management involves four steps
  - Mitigation : Minimzing the effect of disaster
  - Preparedness : Planning on how to tackle the disaster
  - Response: Providing relief
  - Recovery: Enabling normalancy 
 For our project, we believe that Preparedness and Response occupy the core

# Preparedness
 **Training**
  - Helping the community to prepare for disasters.
>    We believe prevention is better than cure 

**Informing**
 - Providing information to the people that would be affected by the disaster, via SMS/email,

# Response:
To respond to the disaster, we plan the following facilites be avialable in our app
**For victims**

- SOS alerts to relief teams
- Suggesting/Compiling for the sake of  victims, the nearest rescue centers and hospitals
- Once safe, alerts to the relatives of the concerned
 
**For Other services**
 - Maintain a databse of all rescued people, for ease of accountability
 - For volunteer services to be able to collect resources 
 - For people to donate to the rescue, by donating to the volunteer serivces
 - 
> In this project we have decided to focus more on a particular disaster managemnet,
i.e *Floods* and *Cyclones* and other disasters later on other disasters

***We believe that we can strongly make a difference in diaster management with the help of our Compannio app***

We thank codefundo++ for giving a chance to pitch in our idea, Thank you :)
